# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis
Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze transactional sales data from a coffee shop chain to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior, identify high-performing stores and products, and generate insights that can support data-driven decision-making in areas such as inventory planning, store operations, and marketing strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Project Explanation:
The dataset provided contains detailed transactional information for coffee shop sales, including variables such as:

transaction_id: A unique identifier for each transaction.

transaction_date: The date on which the transaction occurred.

transaction_time: The specific time the transaction was recorded.

transaction_qty: Quantity of products sold in a transaction.

store_id: Unique identifier for each store.

store_location: Geographic location of the store (e.g., city or neighborhood).

product_id: Identifier for each product sold.

unit_price: Price per unit of the product sold.

product_category: Broad classification of the product (e.g., beverage, food, merchandise).

product_type: Specific type under each category (e.g., coffee, tea, sandwich).

product_detail: Detailed description of the product (e.g., cappuccino, latte, croissant).

This project involves cleaning and preparing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building visual dashboards or summary reports. The goal is to answer key business questions, such as:

What are the peak sales hours and days?

Which products and categories generate the highest revenue?

How do store performances compare by location?

Are there seasonal trends in product preferences?

How can inventory and staffing be optimized based on sales patterns?
